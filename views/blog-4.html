            students based on their logical ability, decision-making skills, and
            personality. The aptitude tests help the employers to assess the
            skills and abilities of candidates as it reflects their capacity to
            do the job. It could be either an online one or a paper-based test.

            Generally, the aptitude tests consist of quantitative aptitude,
            logical reasoning, and verbal reasoning. They are multiple-choice
            questions and are conducted to assess the candidate’s creativity,
            innovation, problem-solving skills and precision.
