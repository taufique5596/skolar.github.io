            the company ABC. I have always wanted to work with a company having
            a positive work environment.

            <b> 3. “Out of all the candidates, why should we hire you?</b><br />
            This is one of the most asked tricky questions. This is the best
            chance to tell the interviewee about your strengths, skills and most
            important tell them about your uniqueness. So craft the response
            according to job you are applying for.<br />

            done.<br />
            Expected answer: you should hire me as a software developer as I
            possess all the skills and experience that you're looking for. I'm
            pretty confident that I am the best candidate for this job role.
            <br />
          </p>

          <p>
            <b> 4. Tell me how other people would describe you?</b><br />
            This is one of the most difficult questions, you have to be crafty
            to frame an answer for this question. But always tell the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 5. What motivates you ?</b><br />
            Here you need not to panic, you can pinpoint all the this that made
            your eyes light up when you read about the job. While answering this
            question you can relate it with any past experience that you have
            and be honest. <br />
            Expected answer : I am always eager to learn new things and take new
            responsibilities so that I am constantly learning and contributing
            more to my team and organization. And I am the kind of person who
            always thrives on hitting and exceeding goals and on friendly
            competition.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b> 6. What makes you unique?</b><br />
            Hey! It’s a good sign. Tell them about your positive qualities.<br />
            Understand the job and keep the specific role you are applying for.
            Emphasize the skills that they are actually looking for. <br />

            Expected answer: What makes me unique is that I basically taught
            myself animation from scratch. I was immediately drawn to it in
            college, and with the limited resources available to me, I decided
            to take matters into my own hands—and that’s the approach I take in
            all aspects of my work as a video editor. I don’t just wait around
            for things to happen, and when I can, I’m always eager to step in
            and take on new projects, pick up new skills, or brainstorm new
            ideas.”(change it)
