            College placements or Campus placement is a program conducted within
            universities or other educational institutions to provide job
            opportunities to students who are in their last year or have
            graduated.
          </p>
          <p><b>How to prepare for campus placement? </b></p>
          <p>
            Before starting your campus placement preparation, make a list of
            your target companies, job posts you are looking for, syllabus,
            companies visiting your college for recruitment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>1. Start with the aptitude preparation:</b> While preparing for
            the core engineering topics most of the students ignore the fact
            that the Aptitude test is the first screening test of the job they
            are applying for. <br />
            Aptitude tests generally comprise Quantitative Aptitude, Logical
            Reasoning, and Verbal Reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>2. Programming Language:</b> even though you are not from the CS
            branch, they require you to have a good command over programming
            languages like C++, Java, or Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>3. Core Knowledge:</b> Every student should brush up on all the
            important topics of their core subjects as you can always expect a
            few questions from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>4. Written and Spoken English:</b> It’s true as in most of the
            interviews English is chosen as the language to communicate.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>5. Resume Building:</b> Believe it or not, the resume plays a
            very important role in your selection procedure. It's the easiest
            way to stand out from others and tell the interviewee about your
            skills and achievements.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>6. Interview Preparation:</b> Most of the students forget to
            prepare themselves for an interview while preparing them for other
            things. Preparing for the interviews before itself can save you from
            nervousness during and before the interview.
